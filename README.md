Problem Theme- Education
Project's Title - UniEdwise
Languages Used - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend - Firebase


Project Description:

We have created a website for students to make their research easier for studying abroad.
Each institute has its own information page where each student can chat with the contributor from the respective institute.
We have used a live chat option from app.drift.com.
Students can find nearby resources from the location of the institute which has been embedded on the institute's page by using google map.
Students create their profile where they can upload all the documents and details.
It allows the users to store documents in one place.
All of these data is stored in the backend securely and can be manipulated.
We have used Firebase as our database.

Future Scope:

This website is scalable as we can add institute's information in the backend and also make the contributor's edit their institute's information.
Also some features like visibility of the document on profile can be implemented more effectively and more information from the students can be stored according to which we can apply filters on the information we provide.
