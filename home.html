            </p>


            <p class="steps">
            <h3> Step 1 : Plan well in advance </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Start your planning about 1 year in advance. </li>
                <li> Keep in mind that getting into the research institutes is not that easy. </li>
                <li> It is important to identify colleges that have the field of study you are interested in, have the
                    type of student organizations and extra-curricular groups that you want to involve yourself in.
                </li>
                <li> Not to forget – countries like the USA, the UK, Australia, Canada, etc., all have a variety of pros
                    and cons, and you need to pay attention to the location of the college. </li>
                <li> Apply into multiple universities to increase your chances of acceptance.<br>
                    Group the colleges you select into three categories :
                    <ol>
                        <li> Two <b>Dream</b> Colleges</li>
                        <li> Two <b>Within Reach</b> Colleges</li>
                        <li> Two <b>Guaranteed Accepted</b> Colleges</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="steps">
            <h3> Step 2 : Complete Admission Tests </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Start giving tests required for admission in the program and college selected by you about 11
                    months before the session starts and about 2-3 months before finally apllying for the college </li>
                <li> Scores of these tests are important both for the admission and the scholarship. </li>
                <li> Most Masters’s programs will require you to take the GRE, and business programs will specifically
                    ask for the GMAT. The IELTS and TOEFL exams are a test of your proficiency in English. </li>
                <li> Preparing for these tests typically takes 2-3 months and even more if you are targeting top
                    colleges. </li>
                <li> Make sure you take a lot of practice tests because nothing else can prepare you for the test better
                    than practice. </li>
                <li> Test scores need to be sent directly to the college. </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="steps">
            <h3> Step 3 : Compile all the important documents  </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> You should have all the required documents at your disposal. </li>
                <li>
                    The main documents common to alll the universities are :
                    <ol>
                        <li> Application Form </li>
                        <li> Academic certificates </li>
                        <li> Entrance Exam Scores </li>
                        <li> Passport size photos</li>
                        <li> Photo ID </li>
                        <li> Letter of Recommendation (LOR) </li>
                        <li> Travel documents </li>
                        <li> Financial documents </li>
                        <li> Statement of Purpose (SOP) </li>
                        <li> Curriculum Vitae (CV) or Resume </li>
                        
                        <li> Essays </li>
                        <li> Health certificates </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="steps">
                    <h3> Step 4 : Start applying to universities abroad </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Start your application process as soon as possible because a lot of universities don't
                            consider
                            late applications </li>
                        <li> Fill in all your basic profile information, submit your admission test scores, etc. Look
                            for any
                            additional information requested by the college in your application. </li>
                        <li> This would be a good time to reach out to the Admissions Department of the college and let
                            them
                            know
                            you are interested in their program and have started your application.
                            Admissions departments are always more than happy to assist students in the application
                            filling
                            process. </li>
                        <li> They might inform you of a scholarship opportunity or even suggest any new programs that
                            might be
                            of interest. And also you might be able to find someone who ends up helping you by
                            recommending you.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="steps">
                    <h3> Step 5 : Don't forget to apply for scholarships </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Apply for scholarships as soon as you come across any opportunity to grab one. </li>
                        <li> University scholarships range from 5%-75% scholarship. </li>
                        <li> You will get surprised to know how much a scholarship can impact your finances </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="steps">
                    <h3> Step 6 : Letters of Recommendation (LOR) </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> colleges will require you to get recommendation letters from either your seniors, managers
                            or
                            someone known in the field.
                            This is an anonymous recommendation that the college will directly ask the recommender to
                            send.</li>
                        <li> Identify the people you will ask for recommendations and let them know in advance before
                            you ask
                            the college to send them a link. </li>
                        <li> Since each college will ask for recommendations, let the person know if you will send them
                            more in
                            the future.
                            Find someone with a good title and also good writing skills so that it can add some bonus
                            points to
                            your application. </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="steps">
                    <h3> Step 7 : Create a strong, compelling resume and essay for your application</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> You should remember that you are in a faraway location, and the admissions office is trying
                            to
                            evaluate you using your application form as your representative.
                            This is your first and only chance to get a foot in the door.
                        </li>
                        <li> The resume is most likely the first document that the Admission Officer will look at.
                            Even if you do not have many achievements that stand out, just the way you organize your
                            information
                            and highlight your best achievements tells a lot about you. </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="steps">
                    <h3> Step 8 : Nail your statement of Purpose (SOP) </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Once you fill out the university application, navigate to the essay section and pick a
                            topic you
                            want to write on.
                            Most schools ask for 1 or 2 essays to be submitted. </li>
                        <li> These are usually generic questions like “What’s the most difficult problem you faced, and
                            how did
                            you react to it?” or “What is the achievement you are most proud of, and why?”.
                        </li>
                        <li> Essay questions are there to check your writing skills and more importantly to evaluate
                            your
                            thought process and to see how much you can involve the reader. </li>
                        <li> Take this very seriously and prepare an essay that conveys clear and articulated thoughts
                            within
                            the
                            prescribed word limit.

                    <ul>
                        <li> Your application will not be touched by the school admissions office until you pay the
                            application
                            fee and hit the ‘Submit’ button.</li>

                            Make sure all the essential items are filled in. </li>
                        <li> Now take a deep breath, feel good about the hard work you put into the application, and
                            submit it
                            to the school.
                            Check for a confirmation email from the school stating they received your application. </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li> This can get tedious at times. Schools do not follow standard practice in responding to
                            your
                            applications.Sometimes they might respond within a week, and sometimes it could take up to 2

                        </li>
                        <li>You need to be patient and check the status of your application regularly.Schools close

                                    receive your documents for proof of admission. This document will later be required

                                    first. You should also know that the bank might not give you 100% of the money. You
                                    might
                                    have to pitch in about 10-15% of your own money. Talk to your family in advance and

                    <h3> Step 12 : Look for the accomodation outside or inside the college campus </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> After getting admit confirmation this should be your first priority to search for the place where it would be economical for you to accomodate during your course. </li>
                        <li>A lot of international students prefer to live outside the campus by renting an partment and
                            living in a group of 4-5 to limit their expenses</li>
                        <li> Try to get in touch with some of your batchmates if possible. </li>
                        <li> If you are not able to do so this step can also be done after going to the place. </li>
                        
                    </ul>

                    <h3> Step 13 : Get your passport ready and apply for Student Visa </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You will need a visa to migrate and live abroad during the course of your study. Students
                            usually acquire a visa which typically remains valid till the end of their school term.
                        </li>
                        <li>Carefully go through the visa checklist for your country and make sure you have all the
                            papers ready. </li>
                        <li>You will need to book an appointment with the visa office or consulate closest to you in
                            order to get the visa stamped on your passport. </li>
                        <li>Spots are limited so do not delay this procedure.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3> Step 14 : Book your flight and get ready for life changing experience </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Airlines offer a lot of discounts on carry-on luggage and travel fares. Make sure to do
                            your research before you book your flight. </li>
                        <li> Pack carefully; almost all countries have strict laws on carrying items such as food
                            grains, batteries, and even computers. </li>
                        <li> Don’t let your Day 1 experience turn out to be a bad one. Once you have your tickets and
                            your visa, just relax, go for a short vacation, feel happy about the hard work you put in,
                            and prepare for lift-off. </li>
